Tenant GW is used for Ingress and API Gateway
- This is specific to:
  - Frontdoor
  - APIM
  - Some App Gateway ingress
  - Traffic Manager

I am waiting for APIM to go GA with support for private link from Front door
- Once that GA's I will extend these examples to include that

Also Frontdoor to static web site/storage backend
